  # Describes the content type that a client supports in various
  # result literals like `Hover`, `ParameterInfo` or `CompletionItem`.
  #
  # Please note that `MarkupKinds` must not start with a `$`. This kinds
  # are reserved for internal usage.

  # A `MarkupContent` literal represents a string value which content is interpreted base on its
  # kind flag. Currently the protocol supports `plaintext` and `markdown` as markup kinds.
  #
  # If the kind is `markdown` then the value can contain fenced code blocks like in GitHub issues.
  # See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting
  #
  # Here is an example how such a string can be constructed using JavaScript / TypeScript:
  # ```typescript
  # let markdown: MarkdownContent = {
  #  kind: MarkupKind.Markdown,
  #	value: [
  #		'# Header',
  #		'Some text',
  #		'```typescript',
  #		'someCode();',
  #		'```'
  #	].join('\n')
  # };
  # ```
  #
  # *Please Note* that clients might sanitize the return markdown. A client could decide to
  # remove HTML from the markdown to avoid script execution.
  class MarkupContent
    include Initializer
    include JSON::Serializable

    # The type of the Markup
    property kind : MarkupKind
    # The content itself
    property value : String
  end
end
