# ClientCapabilities define capabilities for dynamic registration, workspace and text document features the client supports.
# The experimental can be used to pass experimental capabilities under development.
# For future compatibility a ClientCapabilities object literal can have more properties set than currently defined.
# Servers receiving a ClientCapabilities object literal with unknown properties should ignore these properties.
# A missing property should be interpreted as an absence of the capability.
# If a missing property normally defines sub properties, all missing sub properties should be interpreted as an absence of the corresponding capability.
