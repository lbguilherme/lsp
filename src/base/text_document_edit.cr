# Describes textual changes on a single text document.
#
# The text document is referred to as a VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier to allow clients
# to check the text document version before an edit is applied. A TextDocumentEdit
# describes all changes on a version Si and after they are applied move the document
# to version Si+1.
# So the creator of a TextDocumentEdit doesnâ€™t need to sort the array of edits or do
# any kind of ordering.
# However the edits must be non overlapping.
